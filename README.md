# Mexico GeoJSON files

This repository contains GeoJSON files for each state in Mexico updated from the 2020-2022 CONABIO shapefiles.

Each year version is separated into their own folder, so you can choose the best fit for your data.

Through the years, new municipalities have been added. Your dataset may not consider these new municipalities and you would have to use a previous version.

All the files are encoded in UTF-8, the complete Mexico GeoJSON file is inside a ZIP file as it exceeds the maximum file size allowed by GitHub.
