# Mexico GeoJSON

This repository contains GeoJSON files for each state in Mexico updated from the 2020 CONABIO shapefile.

As such, it includes the coordinates from the latest municipalities in Mexico, for example: San Quint√≠n, Baja California.

All the files are encoded in UTF-8, the complete Mexico GeoJSON file is inside a ZIP file as it exceeds the maximum file size allowed by GitHub.
